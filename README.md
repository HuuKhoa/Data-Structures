This repositiory is to store a few coding assignments that I did in C++ for one of my classes.

The data structures that I worked on were a circularly linked list, a binary search tree, and a binary heap.

The circularly linked list has 4 classes which each contain several methonds in order to make sure each class works. A process is simiulated in the code just so that we could test to make sure that the linked list can hold objects and move through the code correctly.
