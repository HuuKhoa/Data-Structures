This repositiory is to store a few coding assignments that I did in C++ for one of my classes.

The data structures that I worked on were a circularly linked list, a binary search tree, and a binary heap.

The circularly linked list has 4 classes which each contain several methonds in order to make sure each class works. A process is simiulated in the code just so that we could test to make sure that the linked list can hold objects and move through the code correctly.

The second file contains the code for a binary search tree. It again has 4 classes and has code in the main to test and make sure that each method in all of the classes works correctly. In the main class, a set of numbers is inserted into the tree and a set of commands are run in order to test and make sure that everything is being added and removed and reordered correctly.

The last file contains the code for a Binary Heap which is used to implement a graph. It has 5 classes with one of those being a class that runs Prim's algorithm on a graph to find the minimum spanning tree for a graph. The main class initializes a graph and then run Prim's algorithm on it in order to find the minimum spanning tree for that graph.
